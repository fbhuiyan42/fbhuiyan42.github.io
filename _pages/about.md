I am Farzana, a graduate student (PhD Research Assistant) in the Department of Computer Science (CSC) at Tennessee Tech University. My research interests include Software Engineering and Machine Learning. To conduct my research activities I have relied on application development, performance analysis, and supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. 

I was born in Bangladesh, a beautiful country in South Asia. I completed my undergraduate studies at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). Besides research, I like to travel, watching movies.
